# Magist SaaS data analysis for Eniac company

## Overview

This project analyzes the general data we got from Magist in order to be able to recommend or not recommend a partnership to Eniac.

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- Tableau
- Google Slides

## Folder Structure

`/1. Magist - Eniac presentation`: Contains the presentation
`/Data`: Magist datadump, extracted .csv files

## Analysis Summary

Magist is not a straight comparable companion to Eniac because of products, volume and sales as well as delivery times. It could be a workable partner, but with heavy clauses on onboarding, scalability etc. As is, Magist is not a recommended partner, but with further information form both sides it could be workable.
